    "I have often wondered why Goodreads, Amazon, and Audible just don't really do a good job in figuring out which books to recommend to me. Perhaps books are a little too personal and situational compared to movies and music. You invest much more time, and often can't boil down your review to just a number. How can you put a work of classic literature alongside a fun comic book? \n",
    "\n",
    "But I decided that I would give it a shot anyway. I decided to try the collaborative filtering algorithm I learned in Andrew Ng's coursera Machine Learning course on a public book rating dataset, and see what I get. Perhaps it would give me some cool ideas for what I should be reading, or at least help me see the challenges in solving this problem.\n",

    "Overall, I am pleased that this algorithm works. It (correctly) recommends books that I have already read and rated highly. If I really only wanted new books to read, I would obviously filter those out, but I kept them in as a sanity check. It recommends more Lord of the Rings book after I said I liked the first one. It also recommends the final His Dark Materials book, after I rated the first two pretty highly.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the level of customization is not exactly top-notch.  I have tried it with various inputs, and it tends to always recommend a few specific titles. A Prayer for Owen Meany, Griffin & Sabine, Anne of Green Gables, and The Secret Garden are favorites. I suspect this sort of collaborative filtering is prone to function in this way. Most people only finish reading something that they are already invested in, and would rate highly. I think it's different than the small amount of investment that people would put in for a movie review. For a second pass at this problem, I would probably try association algorithms using decision trees instead of collaborative filtering. \n",
